iPhone 16 Pro Max vs. Google Pixel 9 Pro XL: Specs Compared

Apple and Google both have big, expensive phones. But how do they measure up? Let's take a look at the specs.

Apple/CNET

Apple's September launch event saw the arrival of the iPhone 16 range, including the base models, the 16 Pro and the biggest 16 Pro Max. At 6.9 inches it's a real whopper of a phone, but Google's Pixel 9 Pro XL is a hefty beast too and both phones pack a lot of top tech to tempt your cash. So let's take a look at the specs to see how these two phones stack up. 

The size is the big similarity here, with the iPhone 16 Pro Max measuring in at 6.9 inches -- a mere 0.01 inches larger than the Pixel XL. It's hardly a difference you'd ever likely notice, but if your primary concern is getting the most screen for your money then the iPhone is leading the way. And while the Pixel's 486ppi pixel density is slightly higher than the iPhone's 460ppi, it's again not really a difference you'll likely notice in everyday use.

Both phones run on home-grown processors. The Pixel 9 Pro XL's Tensor G4 chip has been a bit of a letdown on benchmark tests, putting it more in line with last year's midrange phones and barely any faster than its predecessor. By comparison, even the iPhone 15 Pro Max blew the Pixel out of the water and it's probably safe to assume the same will be true with the 16 Pro Max. That said, benchmarks don't tell the whole story, so we'll have to wait and see how these phones cope with different demanding tasks when we can put them side by side.

The iPhone and Pixel both pack the standard trio of rear cameras -- main, ultrawide and 5x telephoto. The Pixel put up a good fight in my recent comparison against the iPhone 15 Pro Max, but how it compares to the new one remains to be seen. The iPhone's inclusion of ProRaw imagery and ProRes video encoding -- along with the new 4K slow motion mode -- does make the iPhone more appealing to photo and video creators however. 

Neither phone offers expandable storage, but both offer storage capacities up to 1TB and IP68 water resistance.
